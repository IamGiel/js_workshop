## Algorithm for a beautiful coin combination

## Backstory: 

I tried this coding challenge at HackerRank: [Here](https://www.hackerrank.com)

Needless to say I ran out of time, given other priorities.
I am trying to complete this in javascript.
I would like to finish this in my own time for coding practice and nothing more.

If you have alternative solution - please PR.  I would love to see how you approached it.

## Instruction: 

Coins with H (heads) and T (tails)

Given nth number of coins, to be considered a "Beautiful Combination" a set of coin should be: 

1. Uniform (all Heads or all Tails), example:
    - HHHHHHH
    - TTTTTTTTT

2. Starts with two Heads (HH) and ends with two Tails (TT), and in between should have repeated Ts and repeated Hs wherein Hs comes before Ts, example:
    - HHTTTT
    - HHHHHHHHTT
    - HHHHHTTTTTTT

Now, the challenge.  Whats is the least amount of flip to make a set (combination of coins) a Beautiful Combination.

90 minutes - Go!  ðŸ˜… 

If you could not do it in 90 minutes - join me and just start building the best approach for this.

Thanks,
Gel
